                            <h2><strong>Directory</strong></h2>
                    
                            <h3>What all does the basic search look for?</h3>
                            <p>
                                The basic search checks the same categories as the advanced search except
                                it checks if the key term matches any record in those categories.
                                For example, if you enter "computer", the directory returns all alumni
                                with "computer" in their first name, last name, major, graduation year,
                                job category, job title, or employer.
                            </p>
                    
                            <h3>How is the advanced search different from the basic search?</h3>
                            <p>
                                The advanced search returns all alumni that match each of the criteria
                                given. The blank categories are ignored. For example, if you want to
                                search for someone who has a job in finance but not necessarily those
                                who got a degree in finance, then you could enter "finance" in the job
                                category field to search for alumni with a finance job, which might
                                include business, economics, or any other major. 
                            </p>
                    
                            <h3>Are the searches case sensative?</h3>
                            <p>
                                No. Capitalization doesn't matter.
                            </p>
                    
                            <h3>How do you search for graduation year?</h3>
                            <p>
                                The directory returns all the alumni that have a graduation year that
                                contains the digits you provide. For example, if you enter "20", then
                                the directory would return all the alumni that graduated in the 21st
                                century and those that have a "20" in their graduation year such as
                                19<b>20</b> or 2<b>20</b>1 in the future.

                                not required is your phone number.

                                media accounts from account settings page. See <i>Where can I find my

                                This is information only needed by alumni, such as your profile photo, 
                                bio, current job, and availability to talk with current students. Current
                                students can use this information to see who they would like to network
                                with. All of this information is completely optional but would help out 
                                the students tremendously.

                                Singular for alumni. For example, "Look at this distinguished alumnus."
                                The plural would be, "Texas A&M has the best alumni."

                            <h2><strong>General Questions</strong></h2>
                    
                            <h3>Why do I have to use OAuth?</h3>
                            <p>
                                This increases the security of your passwords since the AlumniTraq
                                app does not handle the login at all. You can feel more confident in
                                Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn's ability to keep your password safe
                                rather than a small app built by students.
                            </p>
                    
                            <h3>Do I have to use Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Yes, you have to use one of those three options. On the bright side,
                                you can use any of those options to log you in. Even if you register
                                with Google, you can still sign in with Facebook so long as the
                                emails are the same.
                            </p>
                    
                            <h3>Will logging me out of the application log me out of Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn?</h3>
                            <p>
                                No. Logging out of the app will only log you out of AlumniTraq.
                            </p>
                    
                            <h3>How long can I stay logged in?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Normal users and alumni can stay logged in indefinetly since no sensative information
                                is stored with their accounts. Only users with additional privilegs have a timeout
                                on their login status.
